# Random users database

This application creates a simple ETL process, uploading the results to differents tables on a database 

## Requirements

The application tries to satisfy the following requirements:

1. Create dataset of 4500 users 

2. Split the dataset to 2 gender datasets(male, female) and store each one of the datasets in separated mysql table named “YOUR_NAME_test_male/female”

3. Split the dataset to 10 subsets by dob.age column in groups of 10 (10s 20s 30s etc.)

4. Store each one of subsets in “YOUR_NAME_test_{subset_number} in mysql

5. Write a sql query that will return the top 20 last registered males and females form each one of gender tables you created in 2 and save it as YOUR_NAME_test_20

6. Create a dataset that combines data from YOUR_NAME_test_20 and data from YOUR_NAME_test_5 table. Make sure each row presented only once and there is no multiplication of data. Create json from the mentioned dataset and store it locally as first.json

7. Create a dataset that combines data from YOUR_NAME_test_20 and data from YOUR_NAME_test2 table. In case the same rows are presented in 2 datasets both of rows supposed to be presented. Create json from the mentioned dataset and store it locally as second.json
